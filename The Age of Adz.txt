The Age of Adz

Futile Devices

It's been a long, long time
Since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now
Since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch
I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets
I cover up my face

I do
Love you
I do
Love you

And when you play guitar
I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet
I feel mesmerized and proud

And I would say I love you
But saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long

But you are life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb

And words are futile devices


Too Much

If I was a different man
If I had blood in my eyes
I could have read of your heart
I could have read of your mind
But now I'm lonely instead, I put up a fight
So pick up your battering ram, love
I want to see it

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
Anyway

And maybe I talk too fast
And maybe I talk too much
Give me the sensitive laugh
Or give me the sensitive touch
Even if I could have kissed
And even if I could be the blood
I'm so sorry I tried, love
I want to see it

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
Anyway

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
Anyway

La, la la la la, la la la la, la
La, la la la la, la la la la, la
(There's too much riding on that)
La, la la la la, la la la la, la
La, la la la la, la la la la, la
(There's too much riding on that)

There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that word

There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that

There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that


Age of Adz

Oh, oh, it rots
Oh, oh, it rots
Oh, oh, it rots

Well I have known you for just a little while
But I feel I've known you, I feel I've seen you when the Earth was split in fives
And in your words, I should let it out, I would see it die
But I'm a watcher, I see it watch her, it's in your afterlife
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

Oh keep from trying, oh keep from caring
You are the life
We see you trying to be something else that you're not
We think you're nice
The circumstances of what I thought, I could see it now
I wouldn't be so, I wouldn't feel so, but it's a running wild
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

When it dies, when it dies, it rots
And when it lives, when it lives it gives it all it gots
This is the Age of Adz eternal living

Oh, oh, it rots
Oh, oh, it gives it all it gots
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

And all reflections, I see your method, I see it all
And what about you? And what about me? Are we the lost of lost?
Don't speak too soon, don't be fruit o' loom, don't excite yourself
For what you see is not fantasy, it's not what it gets, but gives
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

And all reflections, I see it mentioned, I see it all
The gorgeous mess of your face impressed us, imposed in all its art
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

When it dies, when it dies, it rots
And when it lives, when it lives it gives it all it gots
This is the Age of Adz eternal living

Oh, oh, it rots
Oh, oh, it gives it all it gots
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

When I die, when I die I'll rot
But when I live, when I live I'll give it all I've got
When I die, when I die I'll rot
But when I live, when I live I'll give it all I've got

Gloria, Gloria - it rots
Victoria, Victoria - it lives in all of us
Gloria, Gloria - it rots
Victoria, Victoria - it lives in all of us

I've lost the will to fight
I was not made for life
I've lost the will to fight
I was not made for life

Now I have known you for just a little while
I feel I must be wearing my welcome
I must be moving on
For my intentions were good intentions
I could have loved you, I could have changed you
I wouldn't be so, I wouldn't feel so
Consumed by selfish thoughts
I'm sorry if I seem self-effacing
Consumed by selfish thoughts
It's only that I still love you deeply
It's all the love I got


I Walked

Lover, will you look at me now?
I'm already dead to you
But I'm inclined to explain
What I could not before

Whatever you didn't do, what you couldn't say
I am sorry the worst has arrived
For I deserve more
For at least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye

Tell me, do you think of me now
As I think of you?
For I could not have shaken
The touch of your breath on my arm

For it has stayed in me as an epithet
I am sorry the worst has arrived
For I'm on the floor
In the room where we made it our last touch of the night

I walked, cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation to what you said
But I'm not about to expect something more

I would not have run off
But I couldn't bear that it's me, it's my fault
I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

Lover, will you look from me now
I'm already dead
But I've come to explain
Why I left such a mess on the floor

For when you went away I went crazy
I was wild with the breast of a dog
I ran through the night
With a knife in my chest, with the lust of your loveless life

I walked, cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation to what you said
But I'm not about to expect something more

I would not have run off
But I couldn't bear that it's me, it's my fault
I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

I walked, cause you walked
I walked, cause you walked
I walked, cause you walked
I walked, cause you walked
I walked, cause you walked
I walked, cause you walked
I walked, cause you walked


Now That I'm Older

It's different now I think
I wasn't older yet
I wasn't wise, I guess

Somewhere I lost whatever else I had
I wasn't over you
I see it run inside itself

And then I called you out
I'm not such older than I was
I'm feeling it's so much right and wrong

And then I woke myself, confused
Your dress comes down to you
Don't get it wrong, don't get excited

I wanted so much to be at rest
Now that I'm older
So be it so of love

The silent man comes down
All dressed in radiant colors
You see it for yourself

To demonstrate my love for you
You I thought I was so in love
Some say it wasn't true

Now that I'm older
Now that I'm older
Now that I'm older
Now that I'm older

There's so much travel yet
And now that I'm older
Someone else can see it for myself

There's so much travel yet
Now that I'm older


Get Real Get Right

I know you want it
I know you really want to get it right
Have you forsaken, have you mistaken me for someone else?
Saturday night you sleep with a rifle at your side
Delivering speeches, delivering speeches left and right
God of hosts created death
Fortune save me from his wrath
Spaceship at the house at night
Prophet speak what's on your mind

You know you really gotta
Get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta
Get right with the Lord

Visit the future, visit the future from the outer space (space space space space)
A ring of fire, a ring of fire falling on your face (face face face face)
You dream of the dark age, you dream of the dark age of your youth
Consider the danger, consider the danger, as it moves

Prophet, royal, priest and king
(I know you want it, I know you really want it)
Snake-skinned master at your feet
(I know you want it, I know you really want it)
Barricade the bathroom doors
(I know you want it, I know you really want it)
Find some things you can't ignore
(I know you want it, I know you really want it)

I know you really gotta
Get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta
Get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta
Get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta
Get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta

I know I've caused you trouble
I know I've caused you pain
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord

I know I've lost my conscience
I know I've lost all shame
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord

I know I've always loved you
I know I've always been
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord

Get real, get right
For you will not be distracted by the signs
Do not be distracted by them
Do yourself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord
Get real, get right
For you will not be distracted by the signs
Do not be distracted by them
Do yourself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord
Get real, get right with the Lord


Bad Communication

I'll talk but I know you won't listen to me
Oh you wouldn't say it but you wanted to
Don't look, don't walk away when I am speaking
I'll take it, but I know it's not for taking

The oneness of one of which you notice me
I told you, do not follow what you couldn't see
Oh, I love you, I love you
Some way, you will want it your way, sunrise
So I would not be mistaken what I know is right
Don't be so funny with me, I'm not laughing
Oh, I love you, I love you


Vesuvius

Vesuvius
I am here
You are all I have
Fire of fire
I'm insecure
For it is all been made to plan

Though I know
I will fail
I cannot be made to laugh
For in life
As in death
I'd rather be burned than be living in debt

Vesuvius
Are you a ghost
Or the symbols of light or a fantasy host?
In your breast
I carry the form
The heart of the Earth and the weapons of warmth

Vesuvius
The tragic oath
For you have destroyed with the elegant smoke
Oracle, I've fallen at last
But they were the feast of a permanent blast

Vesuvius
Oh, be kind
It hasn't occurred, no, it hasn't been said
Sufjan
Follow the path
It leads to an article of imminent death

Sufjan
Follow your heart
Follow the flame or fall on the floor
Sufjan
The panic inside
The murdering ghost that you cannot ignore

Vesuvius
Fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the ghost
Vesuvius
Fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the host

Vesuvius
Fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the ghost

Oh...

Follow me now
Or follow your death
Why does it have to be so hard?
(In your favor)
Follow me now
Or follow your death
(In your favor)
Why does it have to be so hard?
(In your favor)
Follow me now
Or follow your death
(In your favor)
Why does it have to be so hard?
(In your favor)


All for Myself

To bear it down to be in flight
To bear it down to be in flight
It wasn't about me it was only a stone in my shoe
Then worries came to perch on us
Impatience and a painted bust
I kept you close to me close to my ear

We set out once with folded shirts
With hairy chest and well rehearsed
I want it all
I want it all for myself
I'll set it right between your eyes
Your shoulder blades, your running life
I want it all
I want it all for myself

Improving all the time, I am
Improving as I kiss the hem
I promise I won't be a trouble at all
For I'm okay, I'm in the red
Impressions of the unmade bed
You cradled close to me, close to my ear

We set out once forget our shirts
With hairy chests and well rehearsed
I want it all
I want it all for myself
Out in the earth I smell of you
Of bathing boy, amazing you
I want it all
I want it all for myself


I Want to Be Well

To think that I would die this time
Isolated in the room where the bed rises
Photographic ordinary people are everywhere
Extraordinary histories, ordinary histories, ordinary histories

I'll find sleep, I'll find peace
Or in death I'll sleep with ease

To figure that it was my fault
Or so I've come to realize life is not about
Love with someone (ordinary people are everywhere)
Extraordinary people are, ordinary people are, ordinary people are

Everywhere you look, everywhere you turn
Illness is watching, waiting its turn

Did I go at it wrong?
Did I go intentionally to destroy me?
I'm suffering in noise I'm suffering in (touching ordinary bodies)
The burning from within the burning from with (ordinary hysteria)
I could not be at rest, I could not be at peace (extraordinary hysteria)

So do yourself a good, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes
Or do yourself a favor, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes

Illness likes to prey upon the lonely, prey upon the lonely
Wave goodbye, oh, I would rather be dead
I would rather be fine

I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well

And I forgive you even
As you choke me that way
With the pill or demon
And the shrouded shalom
Under conversation
In tremendous weight of
A crowd of ages outside
Dressed for murder

I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be )
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)

And shall I kiss you even
As you take me that way?
With the pill or demon
As my body changes
Apparitions gone awry
They surround me, all sides
But from within I see an unholy change

I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be )
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)


Impossible Soul

Oh, woman, tell me what you want
And I'll calm down without bleeding out
With a broken heart that you stabbed for an hour
Woman, I was freaking out because I want you to know
My beloved, you are the lover of my impossible soul

Woman, too, promise me you'll stay and put off all your woes
I was wigging out, too much worry
I could not get you at all
And you said what you want, you would laugh it off
But I know you won't go, not for it at last
Must you write it off for the impossible soul?
And I was in a dream, I was gone away without you, but not too slow
Lest I put it off, for I put it right for the impossible soul

And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all, my life, to you
If I could get you at all
Don't be a wreck, trying to be something that I wasn't at all

Seems I got it wrong, I was chasing after something that was gone
To the black of night, now I know it's not what I wanted at all
And you said something like, "All you want is all the world for yourself"
But all I want is the perfect love
Though I know it's small, I want love for us all

And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all, my life, to you
If I could get you at all
Trying to be something that I wasn't at all

Do you want to be afraid?
Do you want to be afraid?
For life in the cage where courage's mate runs deep in the wake
For the scariest things are not half as enslaved

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be alone?
Do you want to be alone?
For life isn't stained of righteousness pain
The seed and the hail, all impossible flights for an interesting light

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to love me more?
Do you want to love me more?
For love is the breath
If water and wave
Is cursed by the same thing that nurtured its shame
Is it worth all the work?

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
Have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
Instead of the life, lived tired and lost, have you left it at last
Where it floundered its death with the language of ghosts

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be afraid? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
Do you want to be afraid? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
For life in the cage (for life in the cage)
Where courage's mate (where courage's mate)
Runs deep in the wake (runs deep in the wake)
For the scariest things (for the scariest things)
Are not half as enslaved (are not half as enslaved)

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Now

Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Now

(No, don't be distracted)
(No, don't be distracted)
(No, don't be distracted)

Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest
All my delight, all that mattered, I couldn't be at rest
From what I liked, from what I gathered, I couldn't be at rest
Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest

And don't be shy in the window
Come down and give your best
Oh, delight in the window I couldn't be at rest
Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest
From what I liked, from what I gathered, I couldn't give my best

Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to breathe at all
Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to breathe at all
Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to breathe at all
Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to speak at all

I never meant to cause you pain
My burden is the weight of a feather
I never meant to lead you on
I only meant to please me, however

And then you tell me, boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more together
Boy, we can do much more together

I'm nothing but a selfish man
I'm nothing but a privileged peddler
And did you think I'd stay the night?
And did you think I'd love you forever?
And then you tell me, boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more together
Boy, we can do much more together

I got to tell you, girl, I want nothing less
Girl, I want nothing less
Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure
Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure
