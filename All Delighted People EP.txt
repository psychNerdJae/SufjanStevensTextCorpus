All Delighted People EP

All Delighted People (Original Version)

Tomorrow you’ll see it through
The clouded out disguises put you in the room
And though I wandered out alone
A thousand lights abounded on our home
And I remember every sound it made
The clouded out disguises and the grave
So yeah I know I’m still afraid
Of letting go of choices I have made

All delighted people raise their hands

And I took you by the sleeve
No other reason than to be leading your leading man
And you woke up with a fright
Our lives depended on the visions through the night
All we had always, all we had always wanted to before
The hurricane inclined us, grappling on the floor

All delighted people raise their hands

Still the force of nature spurned
Ideas of strength and style abated by the burning basement
All delighted people raise their hands

I’m not easily confused
The trouble with the storm inside us grew
But I had so much to give
In spite of all the terror and abuse

And the people bowed and prayed
And what difference does it make for you and me?
All delighted people raise their hands

And the people bowed and prayed
And what difference does it make?
It doesn’t matter anyway
The world surrounds us with its hate

Hello darkness my old friend it breaks my heart
I’ve come to strangle you in spite of what you’d like
And don’t be a rascal, don’t be a laughing dog in spite of odds
All I’m deciphering from the spirits in the light within
All delighted people raise their hands

In restless dreams I walked alone I walked alive
The clouded out disguises left me in a dream of lightness
All delighted people raise their hands

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And what difference does it make?
I love you so much anyway
And on your breast I gently laid
Your arms surround me in the lake
I am joined with you forever

And the people bowed and prayed
And what difference does it make for you and me?
All delighted people raise their hands

I’m not easily confused
I feel alive I feel it glowing in the room
All delighted people raise their hands…

And the people bowed and prayed
Oh I love you a lot; Oh! I love you from the top of my heart
And what difference does it make?
I still love you a lot; Oh! I love you from the top of my heart
And on your breast I gently laid all my head in your arms
Do you love me from the top of your heart?
I tried my best I tried in vain. Do you love me a lot?
Do you love me from the top of your heart?

And the people bowed and prayed
Oh! I love you a lot; Oh! I love you from the top of my heart
And you can see through my mistakes
Oh! I’ll tell it to you now; Oh! I’ll tell it from the top of my heart

And what difference does it make
If the world is a mess; if the world is a mess?
And on your breast I gently laid
Oh! I’ll tell it to you now; Oh! I’ll tell it to you now

(When the world’s come and gone shall we follow our transgressions
Or shall we stand strong?)

I tried to save the things I made
Oh! But the world is a mess, Oh! But the world is a mess
And what difference does it make if the world is a mess?
If the world is a mess!
I tried my best I tried in vain
Oh! But the world is a mess!
Oh! But the world is a mess!

Suffer not the child among you or shall you die young when the world's come and gone
Suffer not the child among you or shall you die young when the world's come and gone


Enchanting Ghost

Tell me what you saw in me
And I’ll try to replicate it with a scene
If it troubles you to breathe
Wait a moment; I could change the scenery

Don’t carry on carrying efforts, oh no, oh oh oh oh
Somewhere there’s a room for each of us to grow
And if it pleases you to leave me, just go, oh oh oh oh
Stopping you would stifle your enchanting ghost

It’s only that I meant to bring
Love and liveliness to your breast on the scene
Did you cut your hands on me?
Are my edges sharp? Am I pest to feed?

Don’t carry on carrying regrets, oh no oh oh oh
Somewhere there’s a room for us to speak alone
And if it grieves you to stay here, just go, oh oh oh oh
For I have no spell on you, it’s all a ghost

I still have the things you gave me
Four anointing oils, the paper weight you made
For sure I haven’t carried them
Or buried them in the name of your ghost, my friend

Don’t carry on carrying efforts: Don’t go! No oh oh oh
Stay with me until I sleep within your host
Or if it pleases you to leave me, just go, oh oh oh oh
Stopping you would stifle your enchanting ghost


Heirloom

When your heirloom’s wilted brown
When the devil’s pushing down
When your mourning has a sound
And you hesitate to laugh
How quickly will your joy pass
How quickly will your joy pass

And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more

So do you think I came to fight?
And do I always think I’m right?
Oh no I never meant to be a pest to anyone this time
Oh no I only meant to be a friend to everyone this time

And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more


From the Mouth of Gabriel

Desperate measures lead to death
From the mouth of Gabriel
Who died in his sleep when the world was a very big mess
A very big mess; he saw too much
From now on I will look away from every accident
That may or may not come my way

Saw you were talking up above the Aleph room
Masquerading as a loom
Both of us saw things
No one else would see as well
From the mouth of Gabriel
No one else would hear as well
From the mouth of Gabriel
From the mouth of Gabriel
From the mouth of Gabriel
From the mouth of Gabriel

Don’t be so sure of what you feel, it might as well be trouble
From now on just let the universe be your shelter from the enemy

Your face has changed
I hardly know who you are this time
And what a mess I’ve made of you
You probably would but I won’t let you run away
You probably should but I won’t let you run away this time

Don’t be afraid of loneliness, some refugee beside itself
Instead of what you’ve got
You probably would but I won’t let you go away
You probably should but I won’t let you go away this time

Your face has changed
I hardly know who you are this time
And when I came into your room
You tried to jump

Now I know this is strange to hear from the mouth of God
It was something like a scene from Mars
In a struggle between loves and lies
The angel kept his face covered for to keep his word
And while I spoke something left from my life
Forget about the past
Be at rest I’ll make things right
And while I held you at best you nearly died
Forget about the past
And I’ll try to make things right


The Owl and the Tanager

All I had hoped for
I kept inside your car
The rabbit in the barn

Most of all I wait
I wait beside the door
I wait beside the door

All I was wrong, trembling in the cage
I was diamonds in the cage

In seven hours I consider death
And your father called to yell at me
"You little boy, you little boy"

Found out you cheated me
I ran behind the barn and
Cut my hands somehow

Blood in the meadowlark
I punched your ears instead
I punched you in the head
You only laughed and laughed and laughed

How I was wrong tingling from the kill
Tickle me until you devil bird you evil still
Slept on my arms, I was sleeping in the sill
I was sleeping in the room with you
You little boy, you little boy

How could you run from me now?
The loneliest chime in the house
The loneliest chime in the house
You let it out, you let it out
Come to me Calvary still
I’m weeding and raking until
I’m bleeding in spite of my love for you
It bruised and bruised my will

Counting alluvial plains
The breathing inside of the range
You touched me inside of my cage
Beneath my shirt your hands embraced me
Come to me feathered and frayed
For I am the ugliest prey
For I am the ugliest prey
The owl, the reckless, reckless praise

You said you’d wait for me
Down by the Tannery Creek
Far out by the clothesline where we used to kiss behind the sheets
Wrapped in a blanket of red
The Owl and the Tanager said
The Owl and the Tanager said
One waits until the hour is death


All Delighted People (Classic Rock Version)

Tomorrow you'll see it through
The clouded out disguises put you in the room
And though I wandered out alone
A thousand lights abounded on our home
And I remember every sound it made
The clouded out disguises and the grave
So yeah I know I'm still afraid
Of letting go of choices I have made
All delighted people raise their hands

And I took you by the sleeve
No other reason than to be your leading man
And you woke up with a fright
Our lives depended on the visions through the night
All we had always, all we had always wanted to before
The hurricane inclined us, grappling on the floor
All delighted people raise their hands

Still the force of nature spurned
Ideas of strength and style abated by the burning basement
All delighted people raise their hands

I'm not easily confused

But I had so much to give
In spite of all the terror and abuse

All delighted people raise their hands

Hello darkness my old friend

All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands


Arnika

Arnica might take out the throes that I threw in my head
Bruno, your wife shakes the bedclothes as she makes up your bed

I’m tired of life; I’m tired of waiting for someone
I’m tired of prices; I’m tired of waiting for something

I have a right to know what’s in store; to know what should be said
Could I have it all, could I have you for a night in the warmth of your bed?

I’m tired of life; I’m tired of waiting for someone
I’m tired of prices; I’m tired of waiting for something
I’m tired of life; I’m tired of life
I’m tired of life; I’m tired of life
I’m tired of life; I’m tired of life

Oh be patient with me; for the night weighs on my chest with a terrible storm
Though we may disagree on how things should be done on how crisis is born
Don’t consider it done, wait until Leviathan lovingly creeps in your sill
For he waits in the dark, brooding magically; mustering paperback feelings

No I’m not afraid of death or strife or injury, accidents, they are my friends


Djohariah

I know you won’t get very far
With the back seat driver in the carpetbagger
With the dagger heart grabber stuck in your car

And the yard is grown to a hilt
And the money spent money spent where it went
Embarrassment, embarrassment to pay for the car

And the man who left you for dead
He’s the heart grabber back stabber double cheater wife beater
You don’t need that man in your life

And you worked yourself to the bone
While the people say what they say
It’s the neighbors anyway
They don’t know what’s good for your life

And I see your head hangs low
In the black shadow, half shadow
Living room is fitting is sitting room is fit for your crying

Don’t be ashamed—don’t hide in your room
For the woman is, woman is the glorious victorious
The mother of the heart of the world

Djohariah Djohariah, etc

And the time you held to the light
When the water ran water ran with the strange attic
And when the walls were wet with your life

And you pushed yourself to the floor
And the spirit went where it went
Hovering discovering uncovering your life, on the floor

And the walls were wet with your love

For the mother is, the mother is the glorious victorious
The mother of the heart of the world

Don’t be ashamed, don’t hide from me now
For the woman is the woman is the glorious victorious
The mother of the heart of the world

Djohariah Djohariah, etc

Don’t be ashamed, don’t cry in the bath
For it’s the story of, story of, morning glory story
It’s the gloriole that comes to your path

There is a time when the lights will arise
For the mother is, the mother is the glorious victorious
The mother of the heart of the world

Go on! Little sister! Go on!
For your world is yours, world is yours
All the wilderness of the world is yours to enjoy

Go on! Little sister! Go on, little sister!
For your world is yours, world is yours
All the wilderness of the world is yours

Go on! Little sister! Go on! Go on! Little sister!
For your world is yours, world is yours
All the wilderness of the world is yours

Go on! Little sister! Go on!
For you’re beautiful, beautiful
All the fullness of the world is yours
